<h1>Russian Ukraine Conflicts</h1>
<p>Ukraine’s Westward drift since independence has been countered by the sometimes violent tug of Russia, felt most recently with Putin’s 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>A former Soviet republic, Ukraine has deep cultural, economic, and political bonds with Russia.
In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine, as Moscow saw it becoming more closely aligned with Western institutions, chiefly the EU and NATO.
Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is viewed by some experts as part of a renewed geopolitical rivalry between great powers..</p>
<p>Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 marked a dramatic escalation of the eight-year-old conflict and a historic turning point for European security. With expanding Western aid, Ukraine has managed to frustrate many aspects of Russia’s attack, but many of its cities have been pulverized and one-quarter of its citizens are now refugees or have been displaced. It remains unclear if and how a diplomatic resolution could emerge..</p>

<p> Ukraine’s place in the world, including its future alignment with institutions such as the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), hangs in the balance.</p>
